Since my last post, I made a large architectural change to [Exlytics](https://github.com/corybuecker/exlytics). I replaced Google Firestore with TimescaleDB to store and aggregate page views and click events. Part of my rationale is a desire to explore Kubernetes and run a database on that orchestration service. The other reason is that TimescaleDB is designed to [aggregate time-series data](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/using-timescaledb/continuous-aggregates) with almost no effort.

## Storing and aggregating page views

Exlytics' schema is still very simple:

```markup
                                                 Table "public.events"
   Column    |              Type              | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage  | Stats target | Description
-------------+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+---------+----------+--------------+-------------
 time        | timestamp without time zone    |           | not null |         | plain    |              |
 metadata    | jsonb                          |           |          |         | extended |              |
 inserted_at | timestamp(0) without time zone |           | not null |         | plain    |              |
 updated_at  | timestamp(0) without time zone |           | not null |         | plain    |              |
Indexes:
    "events_metadata_index" gin (metadata)
    "events_time_idx" btree ("time" DESC)
    "events_time_metadata_index" btree ("time", metadata)
```

On top of this schema, I have created two [continuous aggregates](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/using-timescaledb/continuous-aggregates). TimescaleDB surfaces these as materialized views and updates them on a user-configurable cadence. For this post, I am going to be referencing the page views view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW page_views WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket ('1day', time) AS day,
  metadata ->> 'host' as host,
  metadata ->> 'page' as page,
  count(1)
FROM
  events
GROUP BY
  day,
  host,
  page
;
```

```markup
                                    View "public.page_views"
 Column |            Type             | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage  | Description
--------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+---------+----------+-------------
 day    | timestamp without time zone |           |          |         | plain    |
 host   | text                        |           |          |         | extended |
 page   | text                        |           |          |         | extended |
 count  | bigint                      |           |          |         | plain    |
```

Very next on my to-do list for Exlytics is adding a site identifier so that the service can be used on multiple websites. Because TimescaleDB automatically indexes all dimensions, this will remain performant even with multiple site identifiers.

## Reporting page views by day and page

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is another technology skill I try to keep up-to-date. At a previous  job, we built complex usage-reporting dashboards using v2 of D3.  Building charts of page views and link clicks is trivial with D3.js.

I decoupled the event collection application from the reporting application. They are both simplistic enough to use a single application or  an umbrella application. I wanted to use the [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) for the dashboard application for later access to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID authentication plugins.

[Exlytics Dashboard](https://github.com/corybuecker/exlytics-dashboard) is open-source and is in a very simple state at the moment. Visualizations are a lot of fun to build.
